## Goals

A first contact with several Bayesian concepts. 
We use the same discrete model for all questions. 

-   Notions of priors, likelihood, posterior.
-   Point summary of posterior distribution: mean, median, mode.
-   Constructing credible intervals.
-   Basic decision theory.
-   Sequential update of posterior distribution.

<!--
Note:

- critically, they have access by week 2 to solution of ex1, and hence of a discrete probability inference function for all of this

- for decision theory, based off: https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~bouchard/courses/stat520-sp2021-22/T2-bayes-estimator-example.html#(2)
  except done with discrete computation instead of 

- include cromwell's rule in the prior construction question

Other potential candidates:

- calibration? might be too much in one week? maybe not if we provide some scaffold code?

- bonus question on taking the discretization limit and conjugacy?
