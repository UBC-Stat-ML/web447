## Goals

-   Point summary of posterior distribution: mean, median, mode.
-   Constructing credible intervals.

--\> decision theory

--\> basic regression

--\> graphical models? (probably later!)

--\> calibration?

-   Different number of heads and tails - binomial
-   Another discrete inference problem? E.g. Mendelian genetics? Many?

All the Bayesian stuff actually keep for following week (keep some of those for )

-   Epistemic vs. aleatoric probabilities
-   Different priors - Cromwell (later?)
-   Limit and conjugacy
-   Predictive (later?)
-   Credible intervals (later?)
-   Equivalence of sequential and batch versions / update a probability given new data (one flip at the time; proof and code)
