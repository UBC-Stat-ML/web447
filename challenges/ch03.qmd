Recall the [decision tree visualization we introduced in the first week](../w01_discrete_inference/topic05_decision_diagrams.qmd).

Create a variant of simPPLe which draws decision trees automatically. 

Specifically, your code should include a function `decision_tree` which takes as input a simPPLe 
probabilistic program, and output a [mermaid string which can be rendered 
in your browser as a diagram](https://mermaid.live/).

Demonstrate your code on two examples: one in class, and one not from the class.
