In this challenge question, we obtain an even more general result than the one presented in Q1 of Homework 10. For this question, recall that a family of distributions $\{q_\phi : \phi \in \Phi\}$ is an exponential family if the density can be written in the form 
$$ q_\phi(x) = h(x) \exp(\eta(\phi)^\top T(x) - A(\eta(\phi))), $$
where $h$ is the *base measure*, $\eta$ is the *natural parameter*, and $T$ is the *sufficient statistic*. (Note that this is the fully general form, where $x$ and $\phi$ may be vectors.)

Show that 
$$ \nabla_\phi \, \KL(\pi \| q_\phi) = \nabla_\phi \eta(\phi) \cdot \left[\mathbb{E}_{q_\phi}[T(X)] - \mathbb{E}_\pi[T(X)]\right].$$ 

**Hints:** Note that $A(\eta(\phi))$ acts as a normalizing constant for a given $\phi$. Use the fact that $\int q_\phi(x) \, dx = 1$ and 
$\nabla \log \int f = \frac{\int \nabla f}{\int f}$
to show that 
$$ \nabla_\phi \, A(\eta(\phi)) = \nabla_\phi \eta(\phi) \cdot \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi}[T(X)].$$
