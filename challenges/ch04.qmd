- You are collecting [lithographs](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/collection-areas/drawings-and-prints/materials-and-techniques/printmaking/lithograph) from a series.
- Each one has a unique serial number, but contrary to standard practice, the artist did not specify the total number of copies in circulation. 
- You possess serial numbers `1, 3, 15`. 


## Q.1 Modelling

Design a Bayesian modelling to try inferring the total number of copies in circulation.
Motivate all choices you make. 


## Q.2 Posterior computation

Approximate the posterior distribution and produce:

1. A posterior PMF.
2. A point estimate.
3. A 95\% highest probability set.
