After doing Exercise 2 consider the following problem:

1. Write a function that takes as input `posterior_probabilities` and builds the highest probability set for any 
$\alpha\in[0,1]$. 
1. Report a $75\%$ highest probability set, making sure that the posterior probability of the set you return does not fall below $75\%$.
