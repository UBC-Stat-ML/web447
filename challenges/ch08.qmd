Fit a hierarchical model in Stan. E.g.,
modify the [tutorial on tidybayes](../w09_workflow/topic06_grouped_data.qmd) to 
make the model hierarchical, following the same model as in [exercise 6](../exercises/ex06.qmd).
(You may also use a different example if you find a data set and describe the model.)
