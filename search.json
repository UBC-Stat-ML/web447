This will prepare us for more complex decision scenarios.\nLet us start by writing the loss function mathematically using indicator function defined as: \\[\\mathbb{1}[\\text{some condition}] = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n1 & \\text{if the condition is true,} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if the condition is false.}\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\] This gives us: \\[L(a, x) = \\mathbb{1}[a = 0] \\cdot (\\$0) + \\mathbb{1}[a = 1, x = 0] \\cdot (-\\$9) +  \\mathbb{1}[a = 1, x = 1] \\cdot (\\$10).\\]\nLet us simplify the expected loss function, i.e. \\[\\mathbb{E}[L(a, X)] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}[a = 0] \\cdot (\\$0) + \\mathbb{1}[a = 1, X = 0] \\cdot (-\\$9) +  \\mathbb{1}[a = 1, X = 1] \\cdot (\\$10)].\\] o do that simplification, first use linearity of expectation which you will recall from probability theory tells us that for any random variables \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\), we have \\(\\mathbb{E}[X_1 + c X_2] = \\mathbb{E}[X_1] + c \\mathbb{E}[X_2]\\) for any constant \\(c\\).\nIn our context, using linearity with \\(c=1\\) allows us to simplify the above to: \\[\\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}[a = 0] \\cdot (\\$0)]}_0 + \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}[a = 1, X = 0] \\cdot (-\\$9)] + \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}[a = 1, X = 1] \\cdot (\\$10)].\\]\nTrick 1: To deal with each remaining term, use that: \\(\\mathbb{1}[a = 1, X = 1] = \\mathbb{1}[a = 1]\\mathbb{1}[X = 1]\\) (check!), and then use linearity with \\(c = \\$ 10 \\cdot \\mathbb{1}[a = 1]\\) to get: \\[\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}[a = 1, X = 1] \\cdot (\\$10)] =  \\$ 10 \\cdot \\mathbb{1}[a = 1] \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}[X = 1]].\\]\nLOTUS: Finally, we have to compute \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}[X = 1]]\\). From our review of the Law of the Unconscious Statistician, this is done as follows: \\[\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}[X = 1]] = \\sum_x \\mathbb{1}[x = 1] p_X(x) = 0 + 1 \\cdot p_X(1) = 1/2.\\]\nTrick 2: you will often take expectation of indicator function, you will always find that \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}[\\text{an event}]] = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{an event})\\).\nPutting it all together: \\[L(a) = \\mathbb{E}[L(a, X)] =  -\\$ 9 \\cdot \\mathbb{1}[a = 1] (1/2) + \\$ 10 \\cdot \\mathbb{1}[a = 1] (1/2) = \\$0.5 \\cdot \\mathbb{1}[a = 1].\\]"

    "section": "Q.3: A minimal universal probabilistic programming language (PPL)",
    "text": "Q.3: A minimal universal probabilistic programming language (PPL)\nIn this question we will write a very short program that will nonetheless be able to perform Bayesian inference on a wide range of Bayesian models \\[\n\\pi(x|y) = \\frac{\\pi(x)L(y|x)}{Z}\n\\] The inference engine of our PPL will be SNIS, where the target is the posterior and the reference is the prior. Thus, we will restrict our PPL to models in which the prior is proper and it is possible to draw i.i.d. samples from it.\n\nDetour: the distr package\nIn the following we will use the package distr, which allows us to work with distributions as objects—a necessary ingredient of every PPL. Load or install it using\n\nif (!require(distr)){\n  install.packages(\"distr\")\n  require(distr)\n}\n\n\nExample: evaluating a distribution function\n\ndistUnif &lt;- Unif(2,3)\np(distUnif)(0.2)\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nExample: simulation\n\ndistPoisson &lt;- Pois(lambda = 3)\nv = r(distPoisson)(1000) # get 1000 iid samples from distPoisson\nhead(v)\n\n[1] 6 6 1 4 4 4\n\n\nThe \\({\\mathrm{Bern}}(p)\\) distribution is not available inside distr. Nevertheless, we can leverage the generic DiscreteDistribution object to create it\n\nBern = function(prob){\n  DiscreteDistribution(supp = 0:1, prob = c(1-prob, prob))\n}\n\nExample: evaluating mass/density functions\n\nd(Bern(0.5))(1) == 0.5\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nShow that the SNIS weight when the target is the posterior and the reference is \\[\nw(x) = L(y|x)\n\\]\nOne of the most important functions in a PPL is the observe statement. It is the only special statement needs to include in their functions when using the PPL. Its function is to accumulate likelihood in order to compute the SNIS weight for any given sample. To this end, the first step is to define a global variable that will be used throughout the program to contain the value of the weight:\n\n\ncurrent_log_likelihood = 0.0\n\nNow, write a function observe(x, dist) where dist is a distribution from the package distr, and x is a value in the ambient space of dist. Fill in the blank below\n\nobserve = function(x, dist){\n  current_log_likelihood &lt;&lt;- current_log_likelihood + FIX_ME\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe operator &lt;&lt;- in R lets us modify variables that live in the global scope from inside a function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt is much more numerically robust to use d(dist)(x, log = TRUE) than to manually compute log(d(dist)(x)).\n\n\n\nCode your first PPL program for the coin bag example from exercise 1. To achieve this, let us start by storing the data as a global variable\n\n\ncoin_flips = rep(0, 4) # observe four heads\n\nNow, write a function my_first_probabilistic_program() by completing the steps\n\nmy_first_probabilistic_program = function(){\n  coin_index = FIX_ME        # sample a coin index from the prior\n  for (i in seq_along(coin_flips)){\n    observe(FIX_ME, FIX_ME)  # accumulate the log-likelihood of each observation given the coin_index\n  }\n  return(FIX_ME)             # return the query: is coin_index a fair coin?\n}\n\n\nWrite a function posterior(f,n) that takes a PPL program like my_first_probabilistic_program and a number n, and performs posterior inference via SNIS using n samples. Use the following template\n\n\nposterior = function(f, n){\n  numerator = 0.0\n  denominator = 0.0\n  for (i in 1:n) {\n    current_log_likelihood &lt;&lt;- FIX_ME # reset the global accumulator\n    f_i = FIX_ME # run the program `f` and capture its output\n    numerator = numerator + FIX_ME # update the accumulator for numerator\n    denominator = denominator + FIX_ME # update the accumulator for denominator\n  }\n  return(numerator/denominator)\n}\n\n\nTest your program by checking that you can approximate the posterior probability of the fair coin obtained in exercise 1, Q.2."
