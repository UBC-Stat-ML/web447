These are not essential for learning the material and can be skipped. Submit your answer at any time. For each that you successfully solve, a week of participation activity will be waived (it does not have to be the same week you submit the challenge question).

The parameters \\((\\mu_\\text{e},\\lambda_\\text{e},\\mu_\\text{p},\\lambda_\\text{p})\\) must be shared across vaccines. In contrast, each vaccine must have its own \\((e,p)\\) pair.\nImplement the model from part 1 in simPPLe. Your PPL function should return the indicator that Moderna is more effective than Pfizer. Use this code to define \\({\\mathrm{BetaMP}}(\\mu, \\lambda)\\)\n\nBetaMP = function(mean, precision){\n  Beta(mean*precision, (1-mean)*precision)\n}\n\nDownload the data and load it using the following (no points for this part)\n\nvaccines = read.csv(\"vaccines.csv\")\nvaccines$groupSizes = as.double(vaccines$groupSizes) # needed due to bug in Binom code\n\nRun your model in simPPLe using posterior with 20,000 iterations, and report the estimated posterior probability that Moderna is more effective than Pfizer. Is there strong evidence for this claim? Note: it takes a couple of minutes to run 20,000 iterations. Therefore, for prototyping it may be easier to test your implementation with fewer iterations.",

For example, in the Ariane 1 success rate analysis we will never get more datapoints since this type of rocket is discontinued.\nAnswer #1 is also acceptable: some approaches use the Laplace approximation instead of MCMC, which is motivated by the central limit theorem (more precisely, the Bernstein-von Mises theorem).\nAnswer #5 is also acceptable: there is indeed ongoing research on so called “non-asymptotic” approaches to bound the error of MCMC algorithms.

CLT: variance of the limiting distribution is equal to the variance of \\(X_1\\).\nFor Markov CLT: we left the variance of the limiting distribution more vague (\\(\\sigma_a^2\\)).\n\nIntuition: because of the dependences between MCMC iterations, the noise of the approximation can be larger compared to the i.i.d. setting.5\n\n\nEffective sample size\nThe MCMC Effective Sample Size (ESS) is an answer to the following:\nQuestion: How many i.i.d. samples \\(n_e\\) would be equivalent6 to my \\(M\\) samples obtained from MCMC?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick for hint\n\n\n\n\n\nApply the following formula, \\(\\operatorname{Var}[a X + b] = a^2 \\operatorname{Var}[X]\\) to both the CLT for i.i.d. samples, and then the CLT for Markov chains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick for choices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[n_e = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sigma_a^2} M.\\]\n\\[n_e = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma_a} M.\\]\n\\[n_e = \\frac{\\sigma_a^2}{\\sigma^2} M.\\]\n\\[n_e = \\frac{\\sigma_a}{\\sigma} M.\\]\nNone of the above\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick for answer\n\n\n\n\n\nCLT for Markov chains gives: \\[\\sqrt{M} (\\bar X_\\text{Markov} - \\mu) \\approx \\sigma_a G,\\] where \\(G\\) is standard normal.\nTaking the variance on both sides: \\[M \\operatorname{Var}[\\bar X_\\text{Markov}] \\approx \\sigma_a^2.\\]\nCLT for i.i.d. gives: \\[\\sqrt{n_e} (\\bar X_\\text{iid} - \\mu) \\approx \\sigma G\\]\nTaking the variance on both sides (we could actually bypass the CLT argument and show the equality below directly in the i.i.d. case): \\[n_e \\operatorname{Var}[\\bar X_\\text{iid}] \\approx \\sigma^2.\\]\nWe have \\(n_e\\) is defined as having the property that \\(\\operatorname{Var}[\\bar X_\\text{iid}] = \\operatorname{Var}[\\bar X_\\text{Markov}]\\), so after some algebra: \\[n_e = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sigma_a^2} M.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimating the asymptotic variance with many chains\n\nThere are many ways to estimate the asymptotic variance (see references below).\nWe start here with the simplest possible scenario:\n\nsuppose we have \\(C\\) independent chains\neach with \\(S\\) MCMC samples.\n\nSince we have \\(C\\) chains, we get \\(C\\) different Monte Carlo estimators:\n\n\\(E_1, E_2, \\dots, E_C\\).\nDenote also the overall estimator by: \\[E = \\frac{1}{C} \\sum_{c=1}^C E_c.\\]\n\nFirst, by the CLT for Markov chains: for any \\(c\\), \\[S \\operatorname{Var}[E_c] \\approx \\sigma^2_a. \\tag{4}\\]\nSecond, since the \\(E_1, \\dots, E_C\\) are i.i.d., \\[\\operatorname{Var}[E_c] \\approx \\frac{1}{C} \\sum_{c=1}^C (E_c - E)^2. \\tag{5}\\]\n\nQuestion: combine Equation 4 and Equation 5 to obtain an estimator for the asymptotic variance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick for choices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\sigma_a \\approx C \\left( \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{c=1}^C (E_c - E)^2\\right)\\]\n\\[\\sigma_a \\approx S \\left( \\frac{1}{C} \\sum_{c=1}^C (E_c - E)^2\\right)\\]\n\\[\\sigma_a^2 \\approx C \\left( \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{c=1}^C (E_c - E)^2\\right)\\]\n\\[\\sigma_a^2 \\approx S \\left( \\frac{1}{C} \\sum_{c=1}^C (E_c - E)^2\\right)\\]\nNone of the above\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick for answer\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining the two equations, we obtain:\n\\[\\sigma_a^2 \\approx S \\left( \\frac{1}{C} \\sum_{c=1}^C (E_c - E)^2\\right).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimating the asymptotic variance with one chain\n\nView a trace of length \\(M\\) as \\(C\\) subsequent batches of length \\(S\\) for \\(M = C \\cdot S\\).\nCommon choice: \\(C = S = \\sqrt{M}\\).\nThis is known as the batch mean estimator.",

For example, Corollary 4 in that review can be used since the MH algorithm is reversible as we will see soon. Corollary 4 requires the following conditions: reversibility, a finite variance, \\(\\sigma^2 &lt; \\infty\\) (reasonable, as the CLT for i.i.d. requires this as well), geometric ergodicity (which we discussed in a footnote of MCMC diagnostics), and Harris ergodicity, which is more of a technical condition that would be covered in a Markov chain course.↩︎\nInterestingly, the noise can also be lower in certain situations! These are called super-efficient MCMC algorithms. Consider for example an MH algorithm over the state space \\(\\{1, 2, 3\\}\\) that proposes, at each iteration, uniformly over \\(\\{1, 2, 3\\}\\) while excluding its current position. It can be shown that this algorithm will have lower variance compared to the i.i.d. simple Monte Carlo algorithm.↩︎\nBy equivalent, we mean: “have the same variance”.↩︎",

    "text": "Expectation of a function of several random variables\nLet us go back to our running example:\n\nImagine a bag with 3 coins each with a different probability parameter \\(p\\)\nCoin \\(i\\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}\\) has bias \\(i/2\\)—in other words:\n\nFirst coin: bias is \\(0/2 = 0\\) (i.e. both sides are “heads”, \\(p = 0\\))\nSecond coin: bias is \\(1/2 = 0.5\\) (i.e. standard coin, \\(p = 1/2\\))\nThird coin: bias is \\(2/2 = 1\\) (i.e. both sides are “tails”, \\(p = 1\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the following two steps sampling process\n\nStep 1: pick one of the three coins, but do not look at it!\nStep 2: flip the coin 4 times\n\nMathematically, this probability model can be written as follows: \\[\n\\begin{align*}\nX &\\sim {\\mathrm{Unif}}\\{0, 1, 2\\} \\\\\nY_i | X &\\sim {\\mathrm{Bern}}(X/2)\n\\end{align*}\n\\tag{1}\\]\n\nExample: computing \\(\\mathbb{E}[X (Y_1+1)]\\) (similar to what you will be doing in the exercise in question 1.1)\nNote: this is of the form \\(\\mathbb{E}[g(\\dots)]\\), so we can use the Law of the Unconscious Statistician.\nHow to do it:\n\nfirst, identify \\(g\\), here it is \\(g(x, y_1, \\dots, y_4) = x(y_1+1)\\) (in the exercise it is slightly different)\ndenote by \\(p\\) the joint PMF of all the random variables in the model\ncompute the expectation using \\[\\mathbb{E}[g(X, Y_1, \\dots, Y_4)] = \\sum_x \\sum_{y_1} \\sum_{y_2} \\dots \\sum_{y_4} g(x, y_1, \\dots, y_4)  p(x, y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4).\\]\nEach sum runs over the point mass of its PMF as before, e.g. \\(x \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}\\).\nRecall: \\(p(x, y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4)\\) can be computed using the chain rule.\n\nRecall the decision tree, how to visualize the above equation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\nS__and__X_0 -- 1.0 --&gt;

This will prepare us for more complex decision scenarios.\nLet us start by writing the loss function mathematically using indicator function defined as: \\[\\mathbb{1}[\\text{some condition}] = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n1 & \\text{if the condition is true,} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if the condition is false.}\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\] This gives us: \\[L(a, x) = \\mathbb{1}[a = 0] \\cdot (\\$0) + \\mathbb{1}[a = 1, x = 0] \\cdot (-\\$9) +  \\mathbb{1}[a = 1, x = 1] \\cdot (\\$10).\\]\nLet us simplify the expected loss function, i.e. \\[\\mathbb{E}[L(a, X)] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}[a = 0] \\cdot (\\$0) + \\mathbb{1}[a = 1, X = 0] \\cdot (-\\$9) +  \\mathbb{1}[a = 1, X = 1] \\cdot (\\$10)].\\] o do that simplification, first use linearity of expectation which you will recall from probability theory tells us that for any random variables \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\), we have \\(\\mathbb{E}[X_1 + c X_2] = \\mathbb{E}[X_1] + c \\mathbb{E}[X_2]\\) for any constant \\(c\\).\nIn our context, using linearity with \\(c=1\\) allows us to simplify the above to: \\[\\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}[a = 0] \\cdot (\\$0)]}_0 + \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}[a = 1, X = 0] \\cdot (-\\$9)] + \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}[a = 1, X = 1] \\cdot (\\$10)].\\]\nTrick 1: To deal with each remaining term, use that: \\(\\mathbb{1}[a = 1, X = 1] = \\mathbb{1}[a = 1]\\mathbb{1}[X = 1]\\) (check!), and then use linearity with \\(c = \\$ 10 \\cdot \\mathbb{1}[a = 1]\\) to get: \\[\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}[a = 1, X = 1] \\cdot (\\$10)] =  \\$ 10 \\cdot \\mathbb{1}[a = 1] \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}[X = 1]].\\]\nLOTUS: Finally, we have to compute \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}[X = 1]]\\). From our review of the Law of the Unconscious Statistician, this is done as follows: \\[\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}[X = 1]] = \\sum_x \\mathbb{1}[x = 1] p_X(x) = 0 + 1 \\cdot p_X(1) = 1/2.\\]\nTrick 2: you will often take expectation of indicator function, you will always find that \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{1}[\\text{an event}]] = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{an event})\\).\nPutting it all together: \\[L(a) = \\mathbb{E}[L(a, X)] =  -\\$ 9 \\cdot \\mathbb{1}[a = 1] (1/2) + \\$ 10 \\cdot \\mathbb{1}[a = 1] (1/2) = \\$0.5 \\cdot \\mathbb{1}[a = 1].\\]",

Akimov picked option 1. In reality, the effect was even more extreme: the detection limit of the dosimeters available was 0.001 R/s whereas in the worst hit region the true value was round 5.6 R/s. A lethal dose is around 500 R.\nA. Akimov and his crew went in the reactor. Most, including Akimov, died from radiation exposure within 3 weeks.\nGo back to the generating code, Section 2.1, to see how I generated the data.",
