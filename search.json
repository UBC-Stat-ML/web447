These are not essential for learning the material and can be skipped. Submit your answer at any time. For each that you successfully solve, a week of participation activity will be waived (it does not have to be the same week you submit the challenge question).

Review the literature on both sides so as to be fair and critical to both sides of the comparison. State and defend the criteria you use. Consider calibration and M-open setups.

Acquire or write an efficient posterior inference method, either using a PPL or from scratch. Develop a novel Bayes estimator and implement it. Benchmark the Bayes estimator on synthetic data, comparing the performance with a naive baseline such as MAP.
