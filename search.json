The final report should analyze at least one real dataset.\nSome resources:\n\nVanderbilt Biostatistics datasets\nTidyTuesday\nInter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research\nWHO mortality data\nThe World Bank Data\nMore…\n\nYou should not pick a dataset that has already been analyzed using the same approach as you.

Review the literature on both side so as to be fair and critical to both sides of the comparison. State and defend the criteria you use. Consider calibration and M-open setups. Examples:\n\nBayesian vs frequentist… regression/classification, feature selection, density estimation, survival analysis, …\nIs there some structure that can be exploited (e.g. informed by the data types for the covariates/features, groups of related features i.e. feature templates, hierarchical approaches, etc), to get better Bayesian methods on these generic classes of inference problems?\n\nA Bayesian inference method over a non-standard data type. Acquire or write an efficient posterior inference method, either using a PPL or from scratch. Develop a novel Bayes estimator and implement it. Benchmark the Bayes estimator on synthetic data, comparing the performance with a naive baseline such as MAP. Examples:\n\nTypes of graphs such as matchings\nPhylogenetic trees or networks\nMultiple sequence alignments\nClustering or feature matrices\n\nCreate a twist on an existing MCMC sampling algorithm, or a novel one. Show it is invariant with respect to the distribution of interest. Benchmark the performance of the method against one baseline using best practices."
