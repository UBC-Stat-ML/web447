**Definition:** $E_1, E_2, \dots$ is a **partition** of $E$ if:

- the $E_i$'s are disjoint, i.e., $$E_i \cap E_j = \emptyset \text{ when } i\neq j,$$ 
- and their union is $E$, i.e., $\cup_i E_i = E$.


## Axioms of probability {#sec-axioms}

- A **probability** is a function $\pr$ that satisfy the following constraints:
    - $\pr$ should take events as input and return a number between zero and one:
      $$\pr(E) \in [0, 1].$$
    - If $E_1, E_2, \dots$ is a partition of $E$, then $$\pr(E) = \sum_i \pr(E_i).$$
    - $\pr(S) = 1$
- Thanks to the constraints, even if I only specify a few known probabilities I can recover many other ones mathematically/computationally.
