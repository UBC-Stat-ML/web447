## Outline

### Topics 

- Random variable as mathematical objects. 
- Notation convention for observation/latent

### Rationale

Random variables are used as building blocks for two key uses in Bayesian stats:
modelling "knowns" (observations) and "unknowns" (latent variables/parameters/prediction). 


## Definition

A (real) **random variable** is a function from a sample space $S$ to the reals, 
$X : S \to \reals$. 

**Example:** 

- Continuing the example with $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$. 
- Consider $X(s) = 1$ if $s$ is odd, and  $X(s) = 0$ otherwise.

## Probabilist's notation

- Let $X$ denote a random variable. 
- The notation $(X = 1)$ or $(X \in E)$ is invalid in set theory. 
- Therefore, probabilists "gave it a meaning" as follows:

$$(X = 1) = \{s : X(s) = 1\}.$$

**Example:** Consider $X(s) = 1$ if $s$ is odd, and  $X(s) = 0$ otherwise. 
Then $(X = 1)$ corresponds to the red circle.

## Conventions: probability vs Bayesian

**Probability convention:** 

- Random variables are denoted with capitals in probability theory
- The same letter in small cap is used for a dummy variable holding the output of the random variable.
    - Note: "A dummy variable holding the output of the random variable" is called a **realization**.
    - Example: $X$ for the random variable and $x$ for its realization.
- We will start off using this convention in the first few weeks. 


**Bayesian statistics convention:** 

- Often the capitalization convention is not used in the Bayesian statistics literature. 
- Hence we will eventually drop the probability theory capitalization convention.


## More conventions

- $X$: unobserved random variable 
- $Y$: observed random variable

More precisely:

- $X$ is the "mechanism of observation"..
- whereas the actual observation is a realization of $X$.


## Extension

A **random vector** is a function from a sample space to $\reals^n$.

**Example in Bayesian statistics:** the vector $(X, Y)$ containing both the unobserved and observed quantities.
