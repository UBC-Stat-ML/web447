## Definition

**Probability Mass Function (PMF)**: 

- denoted by $p$ (not to be confused by $\pr$),
- defined by: $$p(x) = \pr(X = x).$$
- If there are several random variables, we use a subscript to disambiguate the PMFS, e.g.,
    - $p_X$ for the PMF of the latent random variable,
    - $p_Y$ for the PMF of the observed random variable.


# Example: coins

- PMF of fair coin: $p(0) = p(1) = 1/2$
- Generalization: the family of **Bernoulli PMFs**
- Recall: when you flip a "Biased" coin 
    - get a 1 with probability $p \in [0, 1]$ 
    - get a 0 with probability $1 - p$
- $p$ is an example of what is called a PMF's *parameter*
- Notation: $X \sim \distBern(p)$


# Example: discrete uniform distributions

- Example: dice
- Notation: $Y \sim \distUnif\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$


## Simulation/sampling from a PMF {#sec-simulate-pmf}

### In R 

```{r}
require(extraDistr)

# 10 coin flips:
rbern(10, prob=0.5)

# two dice rolls
rdunif(2, min=1, max=6)
```


### How does it work?

- Think of the green lines in the uniform PMF as "sticks" with "labels."
  - The "labels" are the different realization, e.g. 1, 2, 3, ..., 6.
- Place the six sticks in the interval $[0, 1]$ so that they do not overlap.
- Sample a uniform real number in $[0, 1]$ 
  - in R: `runif(1)`
- The uniform falls in exactly one of the sticks.
- Return the label of that stick.


### Mathematical explanation

The above "stick-based" algorithm can be implemented using the cumulative distribution function and a generalization of its inverse known as the quantile function. 

**Cumulative distribution function (CDF):** $F(x) = \pr(X \le x).$

**Quantile function:** $F^{-1}(u) = \inf\{x \in \reals: u \le F(x)\}$. 

Then the "stick-based" algorithm can be written as:

1. $U \sim \distUnif[0, 1]$ 
2. Return $F^{-1}(U)$.
