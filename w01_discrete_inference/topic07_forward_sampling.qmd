## Outline

### Topics 

- Notion of forward sampling (also known as forward simulation)
- How to do it in practice
  - Useful functions
  - Graphical models
  

### Rationale

Sampling is the main way Bayesian inference is performed nowadays. 
We introduce here the simplest flavour of sampling, *forward sampling*. 



## Forward sampling as depth-first traversal



## Coding a forward sampler


## Forward sampling as specifying a model



## Directed graphical model
