## Outline

### Topics

- Quick review of the normal distribution.
- Different parameterizations. 


### Rationale

The normal distribution is often used in Bayesian analysis when one needs a prior over an unknown $x$ such that $x \in (-\infty, \infty) = \reals$.

## Parameterizations

- There are **different conventions** to measure the spread. 
    - Standard deviation $\sigma$.
    - Variance, $\sigma^2$.
    - Precision, $\tau = 1/\sigma^2$. 
- **Keep that in mind** as different languages will use different conventions!
- Standard deviation is the most intuitive:
    - it is the width of the bell,
    - the only one that has the same units as $x$ (e.g. if $x$ is in meters, so is $\sigma$).
