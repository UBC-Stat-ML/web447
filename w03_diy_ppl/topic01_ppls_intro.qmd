## Outline

### Topics

- What is a Probabilistic Programming Language (PPL)?
- Why PPLs are central to modern Bayesian inference.

### Rationale

PPLs is the main way you will compute posterior distributions in this course. 


## PPL in a nutshell


## This week's running example 

- TODO: start with mis-specification discussion - use the example to motivate the need for more complicated probability models


## Why? The PPL revolution.

- Computing posterior by hand difficult, e.g.,
    - when there are many random variables (decision tree has exponentially many leaves),
    - when there are continuous distributions (which we will review this week).
    
## PPL: an example

```r
print("ok")
```

```{r}
print("ok")
```

- TODO: show how to use the assignment...

```r {shortcodes=true, eval=false, filename="matplotlib.py"}
