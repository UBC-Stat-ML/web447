## This week's outline

- The success of Bayesian methods **and** Lego Blocks can be traced to the same basic reasons:
    - A varied set of basic building blocks.
    - The ability to combine them freely.
    
- This week, we introduce:
    - more examples of basic building blocks (i.e., distributions),
    - creating your own building blocks (i.e., custom distributions),
    - more examples of using simple building blocks to construct complex things (mixtures).
