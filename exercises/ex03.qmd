## Goals

- Introduce Monte Carlo integration in continuous spaces.
- Review the concept of importance sampling.


## TODO

- 1 - continuous MC on bounded space and uniform proposalâœ…
- 2 - continuous IS on unbounded space and e.g. exponential proposal
	-> bonus: something about 100x more samples needed for 1 more digits using log-log plot (maybe done in class instead?)
	-> bonus/challenge question? or maybe in class instead?: questions on ESS?
	-> bonus? an example where the expectation does not converge due to non-integrability
- 3 - guided steps to universal PPL (providing scaffold code)
	- test case: discrete model from last time (e.g. one for parameters posterior)
	- extending to cover predictive?
	- model with two variables? (can wait until regression)
	

## Q.1: functions on the unit interval

1. Write a function `mc_estimate` that takes a function $f:[0,1]\to\reals$ and 
outputs a Monte Carlo estimate of $\int_0^1 f(x)\dee x$ using $n=10000$ 
independent samples from $\distUnif(0,1)$.

2. Consider the function $f:[0,1]\to[0,\infty)$ given by
$$
f(x) = \frac{x^{-1/3}}{\sqrt{1-x}}.
$$
Show that
$$
\int_0^1 f(x)\dee x = \frac{\pi}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)}.
$${#eq-integral}
Hint: look at the expression for the 
[density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution#Probability_density_function) 
of a $\distBeta(\alpha,\beta)$ distribution, and remember that it must integrate
to one. Then use the fact that for any $\gamma\in(0,1)$, the 
[beta function satisfies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_function#Other_identities_and_formulas) 
$$
\operatorname{B}(\gamma,1-\gamma) = \frac{\pi}{\sin\left(\gamma\pi\right)}.
$$
3. Test your implementation of `mc_estimate` by checking that it produces an
answer close to the value in @eq-integral.
4. In order to quantify the uncertainty inherent in the output of the previous 
step, we will construct a confidence interval[^1] for our Monte Carlo estimate
    a. Approximate the standard error of the estimator by computing the standard
       deviation of $K=30$ i.i.d. replications of `mc_estimate(f)`.
    b. Use the Central Limit Theorem to provide an asymptotically exact
       95% confidence interval.
    
[^1]: Yes, the frequentist concept! Monte Carlo simulation is one 
      instance where the assumptions of frequentist inference hold by design.

5. The following integral, known as the sine integral, does not have an analytic
expression
$$
\int_0^1 \frac{\sin(t)}{t} \dee t.
$$
Estimate its value using `mc_estimate(f)` and provide a 95% confidence interval.
