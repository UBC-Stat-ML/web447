Here are the functionalities in `distr` you will need for the exercise 

Loading the package without annoying prompt:

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(require(distr))
```


## Creating a distribution object

Let's create a Poisson with parameter $\lambda = 3.2$, which we will use in the following
to demonstrate the functionalities in `distr` you will need for the exercise 

```{r}
distPoisson <- Pois(lambda = 3.2)
```

## Sampling from it 

Here, we sample from our Poisson distribution 1 time:

```{r}
r(distPoisson)(1)
```


## Evaluating the PMF or density

Here we compute the PMF of a poisson at the realization $x = 4$:

```{r}
d(distPoisson)(4)
```
