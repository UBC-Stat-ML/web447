## TENTATIVE goals/ideas

- Approximate a regression/classification posterior distribution using a PPL.
    - use sequence of launch data? idea is that success pr will be increasing.. should be stark enough to see a trend in posterior
    - for now, give them prior, model in mathematical notation that they have to translate
- Using packages to visualize a 1d and 2d posterior distribution and interpreting these plots. 
    - interpretation could be to 
- Performing prediction using a PPL. 
    - ask to do the insurance question again based on this new data and model
    
    
ANYTHING ELSE?? Probably math questions will be better fit next week. Maybe enough?


## Q.1: classification

$$
\begin{aligned}
\alpha &\sim \distNorm(0,10^2) \\
\beta &\sim \distNorm(0,10^2) \\
y_t|\alpha,\beta &\distiid \distBern(\sigma(\alpha+\beta t))
\end{aligned}
$$
where
$$
\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}
$$
is the logistic function (aka the sigmoid function). In `R` you can compute it
using `plogis(x)`.
