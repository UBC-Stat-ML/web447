## TENTATIVE goals/ideas

- Approximate a regression/classification posterior distribution using a PPL.
    - use sequence of launch data? idea is that success pr will be increasing.. should be stark enough to see a trend in posterior
    - for now, give them prior, model in mathematical notation that they have to translate
- Using packages to visualize a 1d and 2d posterior distribution and interpreting these plots. 
    - interpretation could be to 
- Performing prediction using a PPL. 
    - ask to do the insurance question again based on this new data and model
    
    
ANYTHING ELSE?? Probably math questions will be better fit next week. Maybe enough?
