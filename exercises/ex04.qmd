Make sure to read the [simPPLe setup page](../w04_glms/topic01_simPPLe.qmd) before you begin. 


## Q.1: logistic rocket improvement

Consider the [Ariane 1 data we used this week](../w04_glms/topic04_classification.qmd#sec-data), 
```r
success_indicators = c(1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
```
and the [model described in the same page](../w04_glms/topic04_classification.qmd#sec-model). 

Recall that we discussed a model where the reliability of the rocket changes in time. This will allow us to
incorporate, for example, the fact that engineering teams implement fixes based
on past launches and therefore the probability of success should increase.

1. Write a function called `logistic_regression` containing a [simPPLe](../w04_glms/topic01_simPPLe.qmd) 
  probabilistic programming description 
  of [the model described in class](../w04_glms/topic04_classification.qmd#sec-model). 
  Your function should return a vector containing 3 elements in the following order:
    1. the intercept ($\in \reals$),
    2. the slope ($\in \reals$),
    3. a prediction if one more launch would have been successful (1) or a failure (0) ($\in \{0, 1\}$).
2. Follow the instructions in [the appendix below](#sec-utils) to get some helper functions. 
    Use these functions to reproduce the lecture's bivariate posterior plot over the intercept and slope parameters. 
3. Estimate the probability that the next launch is a success given the data under the **logistic model**. 
4. Create a variant of the same model but where the slope is set to zero. 
    Estimate the probability that the next launch is a success given the data under this **simplified model**. 
    
    
## Q.2: choosing a model

You debate with your friend whether the logistic model or the simplified model (with slope equals to zero) should be preferred. 
To stop that debate, write a **unified model** which gives probability 1/2 to the simplified model, and 1/2 to the logistic model. 
Estimate the posterior probability that the logistic model is preferred under the unified model given the same data as in Q.1.

<!--
## Q.2: change-point improvement

Consider an alternative approach where instead of logistic function, we use a [step function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_function) 
with 2 steps (think of a mini stair case with two steps). 

Estimate the probability that the next launch is a success given the data under the change point model.

## Appendix {#sec-utils}

For Q.1.2, you will need to copy the following code and paste it in a file 
called `simple_utils.R`. We have demonstrated the use of these functions 
[in the lectures](../w04_glms/topic02_bivariate.qmd).

```r {shortcodes=true, filename="simple_utils.R"}
{{< include ../blocks/simple_utils.R >}}
```
