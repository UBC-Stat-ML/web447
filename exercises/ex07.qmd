## Q.1: installing and running Stan

Report the posterior median in 
the [mini Stan exercise from the notes](../w08_mcmc1/topic01_installing_stan.qmd#running). 


## Q.2: regression in Stan

In this question, you will analyze the 
[Hubble data we encountered earlier in the course](../w04_glms/topic05_regression.qmd) 
but using different priors, and with Stan instead of simPPLe. 

First, access the data as follows:

```r {shortcodes=true, filename="ex07_import_hubble.R"}
{{< include ex07_import_hubble.R >}}
```

Second, write a Stan model following the same structure as the model from 
[last time we analyzed this data](../w04_glms/topic05_regression.qmd) 
**except** that the following priors should be used:

- for the slope parameter, `student_t(3, 0, 100)`
- for the standard deviation parameter and exponential with rate `0.001`

Run stan for 2000 iterations and 
report a histogram on the quantity of interest, i.e., the slope parameter.


## Q.3: a simple MCMC algorithm

In this question, you will implement a random-walk Metropolis algorithm with a 
standard normal proposal. 

Start with the following scaffold code that encodes the posterior distribution of interest. 
More specifically, this encodes an un-normalized distribution $\gamma(p)$ given by 
prior times likelihood. 

```r {shortcodes=true, filename="ex07_scaffold.R"}
{{< include ex07_scaffold.R >}}
```

Complete the blanks in the following:

```r
# simple Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (normal proposal)
simple_mh = function(gamma, initial_point, n_iters) {
  samples = numeric(n_iters) 
  dim = length(initial_point)
  
  # TODO
  
  return(samples)
}
```

Use this function to compute the posterior mean of the model encoded in `gamma_beta_binomial`. 

Compute the posterior mean of $p$ using:

1. 1000 iterations of MCMC,
2. analytic computations based on [the practice quiz 1 question](../w07_quiz1/topic02_practice_questions.qmd).
