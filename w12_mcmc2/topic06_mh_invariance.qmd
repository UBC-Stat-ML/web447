## Outline

### Topics

- Invariance of MH

### Rationale

We can now complete [the **plan** laid earlier](topic03_markov_lln.qmd).


## Invariance of symmetric proposal MH

- Recall: invariance is a synonym for "satisfying the global balance equation"
- Strategy
    - Since detailed balance implies global balance,
    - If we can prove detailed balance we are done, i.e. it is enough to show
    $$\pi(x) K(x' | x) = \pi(x') K(x | x').$$ {#eq-detailed-balance}

**Proof:** 

- Start with the subcase $x' \neq x$. 
- We know from [our previous calculation](topic02_mh_as_markov.qmd) that:
  $$K(x' | x) = q(x'|x) \alpha(x, x'),$$ where $\alpha(x, x') = \min(1, r(x, x'))$ and $r(x, x') = \gamma(x') / \gamma(x) = \pi(x') / \pi(x)$. 
- Hence: the left hand side of @eq-detailed-balance is:
\begin{align*}
\pi(x) K(x' | x) &= \pi(x) q(x'|x) \alpha(x, x') \expl{previous calculation} \\
&= \pi(x) q(x'|x) \min(1, r(x, x'))  \expl{by definition} \\
&= \pi(x) q(x'|x) \min(1, \pi(x') / \pi(x)) \expl{by definition}. \\
\end{align*}

Now note that $a \min(1, b) = \min(a, ab)$, hence,

\begin{align*}
&=  q(x'|x) \min(\pi(x), \pi(x')).
\end{align*}

Now the last expression has the nice property that we can swap $x$ and $x'$, since:

- $\min(a, b) = \min(b, a)$,
- $q(x'|x) = q(x | x')$ by the symmetric proposal assumption. 

Hence, doing all the steps in reverse with $x$ and $x'$ permuted, we get 
$$\pi(x) K(x' | x) = \pi(x') K(x | x'),$$
i.e., detailed balance.

**Exercise:** finish the argument by considering the case where $x' = x$.
