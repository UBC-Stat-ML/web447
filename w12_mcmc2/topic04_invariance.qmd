## Outline

### Topics

- Intuition behind invariance
- Invariance as a fixed point


### Rationale

Invariance is the key condition needed to establish 
a [law of large numbers for Markov chains](topic03_markov_lln.qmd). 
Hence it is useful to build some intuition on what it means. 



## Analogy: fixed point iteration 

**Goal here:** gaining some intuition on what is the notion of $\pi$-invariance, using an analogy. 

### Fixed point iteration

- You are given a function $f(x)$ 
- Game:
    - Pick any starting point $x_1$ (e.g. in figure, $x_1 = -1$)
    - Compute $x_2 = f(x_1)$ (e.g. in figure, $x_2 = 0.5$)
    - Compute $x_3 = f(x_2)$
    - Compute $x_4 = f(x_3)$
    - etc.
- Can we predict where will $x_n$ end up after an infinite number of iterations?
    - Hint: try to understand why the figure has a blue line $y = x$.


### Fixed points

**Surprise:** sometimes, we can predict where $\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n$ ends up!

**Definition:** a **fixed point** of a function $f$ is a point $x$ such that $f(x) = x$.

**Question:** what are the fixed point in this picture?

## Click for answer

The 3 yellow points. These are the points where the curve intersect the line $y = x$.

**Example:** 

- look at the fixed point iteration picture more closely,
- note that indeed here we end up at a fixed point (blue diagonal line shows the linear function $y = x$)

### Back to Markov chain

**Intuition:** $\pi$-invariance means "$\pi$ acts like a fixed-point of $K$." 

**Connection:** 

- replace "points" by "probability distributions",
- replace "function application" by "simulating the Markov chain for 1 step",
- replace "fixed point" by "$\pi$-invariance".
