## Outline

### Topics

- Global balance (synonym: invariance)
- Detailed balance (synonym: time-reversibility)

### Rationale

We need formulas to help us prove that MH is [$\pi$-invariant](topic04_invariance.qmd) 
(and [hence combined with irreducibility, admits a LLN](topic03_markov_lln.qmd)).


## Example

We continue our [eccentric tourists example](topic05_cke.qmd)...

**Question:** which travelling scheme(s) are $\pi$-invariant?

**Intuition:** $\pi$-invariance in this context just means the fraction of tourists in each city will stay constant over time.

a. Pairs of cities, where each pair of cities is assigned a fixed number of planes going back and forth between the two cities (see figure, planes always full). 
b. A **tour** where a fixed number of planes, equal to the number of cities, go around the world on a common route (see figure, again, planes always full). 
c. A central "hub", where all flights land at the hub (see figure, again, planes always full).

## Global balance 

**Question:** combine 

- the [definition of $\pi$-invariance](topic04_invariance.qmd), with  
- [the formula we derived for the marginals of a Markov chain](topic05_cke.qmd), i.e.,
    $$\mu_2(x') = \sum_x \mu_1(x) K(x' | x),$$
    
to get an equation characterizing $\pi$-invariance in terms of $K$.

## Detailed balance

**Question:** write mathematically "pairs of cities, where each pair of cities is assigned a fixed number of planes going back and forth between the two cities (planes always full)."

## Relationship between detailed and global balance

**Question:** what is the relationship between local and global balance? Does one imply the other?
