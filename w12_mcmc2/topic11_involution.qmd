## Outline

### Topics

- Deterministic proposals
- Involutions
- Proposal Jacobian determinants


### Rationale

In our [first exposure to MH](../w08_mcmc1/topic04_mh.qmd), we defined the proposal as a probability distribution 
$q(\cdot|x)$ based on the current point $x$. 

For HMC, it is more natural to consider 
the proposal as a deterministic function $T(x)$. 

We state a version of the MH algorithm based on such deterministic proposal here.  


## MH with deterministic proposals

**Algorithm:** 

1. Denote the current state by $x \in \reals^d$ 
2. **Propose:** $x^* = T(x)$ for some deterministic proposal mapping $T : \reals^d \to \reals^d$ 
    - **Assume:** $T$ must satisfy $T = T^{-1}$. 
    - This property is called **involution**. 
3. Compute the ratio,
  $$r(x) = \frac{\gamma(x^*)}{\gamma(x)} | \nabla T(x) |,$$
  where $| \nabla T(x) |$ denotes the determinant of the [Jacobian determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant#Jacobian_determinant).
4. Accept $x^*$ with probability $\alpha(x) = \min(1, r(x))$, otherwise stay at $x$. 

**Calculus review:** do you remember what is the Jacobian determinant?

\begin{align*}
\nabla T(x) &= \begin{bmatrix}
    \dfrac{\partial T_1}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial T_1}{\partial x_n}\\
    \vdots                             & \ddots & \vdots\\
    \dfrac{\partial T_m}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \dfrac{\partial T_m}{\partial x_n}
\end{bmatrix} \\
|\nabla T(x)| &= |\det  \nabla T(x)|.
\end{align*}

**Proposition:** [(Tierney, 1998)](https://doi.org/10.1214/aoap/1027961031) if $T$ is a continuously differentiable involution, then the above algorithm is $\pi$-invariant. 


## Examples of involution

**Swaps:**

- Set $T(x_1, x_2) = (x_2, x_1)$. 
- To show involution, compute $T^2(x) = T(T(x))$ and show $T^2 = I$, the identity map. 
- $T(T(x_1, x_2)) = T(x_2, x_1) = (x_1, x_2)$ âœ…



**Multiplicative proposal:** complete the definition of $T$ to make it an involution on $\reals \times \reals^+$.
  $$T(x_1, x_2) = T(x, m) = (mx, \_\_).$$

**Question:** Compute the Jacobian determinant of the multiplicative proposal involution.

## Click for hint 

You should get a **triangular matrix** i.e. in our context of the form

\begin{align*}
\nabla T &= \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11} & a_{12} \\
    0 & a_{22}
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}

Now recall that from [properties of triangular matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_matrix#Properties), 
this means that to compute it determinant, you just have to compute the product of the diagonal entries, $\det \nabla T = a_{11} a_{22}$.
