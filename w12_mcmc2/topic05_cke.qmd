## Outline

### Topics

- Computing a marginal of a Markov chain. 


### Rationale

The notion of invariance is formally expressed using marginals of a Markov chain. 
To check invariance we need formulas to write marginals of Markov chains.


## Example

- Consider a large group of eccentric tourists.
- They travel the world in a finite set of cities (dots). 
- Every weekend they can board a plane and go somewhere else. 
    - They base their choice of destination **only on the current city**.
    - They may use randomness. 
- The game starts on Monday

### Markov model for random tourists

- $X^{(1)}$: pick one of the tourists at random,  $X^{(1)}$ encodes the city this tourist is in at week 1.
- Distribution of $X^{(1)}$: $\mu_1(x)$. 
  - Interpretation: for city $x$, $\mu_1(x)$ tells you the fraction of tourists in city $x$ on the first week. 
  - Size of the dots in the figure is the fraction of tourists in the city. 

**Review:** what is the name of the distribution of $X^{(1)}$?

## Click for answer

The initial distribution. 
:::

- $K(x'|x)$ encodes the probability that a tourist move to city $x'$ next week given they are at $x$ this week. 
- $X^{(2)} \sim K(\cdot|X^{(1)})$. 
- On the second week, some cities may now have more or less tourists. 
- Distribution of $X^{(2)}$: $\mu_2(x)$.
  - Interpretation: for city $x$, $\mu_2(x)$ tells you the fraction of tourists in city $x$ on the **second** week. 



## Marginal of a Markov chain

### Definition

**Definition:** the distribution on $X^{(m)}$ is called the **marginal**, denoted $\mu_m(x)$. 


## Computing a marginal

**Question:** write the marginal distribution at step 2, $\mu_2$ using $\mu_1$ and $K$.
