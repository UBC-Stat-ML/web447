## Intuition

- Let $\pi$ denote our target density. 
- Take the log and take the negative: $U(x) = - \log \pi(x)$. 
- Now imagine a **marble rolling on the landscape** $U(x)$. 
    - Position at time $t$: $x^{(t)} \in \reals^d$
    - Momentum at time $t$: $p^{(t)} \in \reals^d$
        - If you are rusty with physics, for today since we use marbles of mass one, think of momentum = velocity.
- HMC at a high level: 
    1. **proposal**: from the current position, let the ball roll for time $t$ (approximately)
        - the position at time $t$ is the proposal.
    2. Perform an **MH accept/reject step** based on that proposal.
    3. **Sample a new momentum**.

## Conservation of energy

**Why** would "rolling a marble on $U$" be a good proposal?
        
**Key insight**: ignoring friction, recall from elementary physics that we have **energy conservation**,
\begin{align*}
\text{Hamiltonian}^{(t)} &:= \text{potential energy}^{(t)} + \text{kinetic energy}^{(t)} = \text{constant}
\end{align*}
where:
\begin{align*}
\text{potential energy}^{(t)} &:= U(x^{(t)}), \\
\text{kinetic energy}^{(t)} &:= K(p^{(t)}) :=  \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^d (p_i^{(t)})^2, \\
\text{Hamiltonian}^{(t)} &:= H(x^{(t)}, p^{(t)}) = U(x^{(t)}) + K(p^{(t)}).
\end{align*}

**Formalizing this idea:**

- Let $\bar \pi(x, p) \propto \exp(-H(x, p))$.
- **Note:** the original target $\pi$ is a marginal of $\bar \pi$:
  \begin{align*}
  \int \bar \pi(x, p) \dee p &\propto \int \exp(-U(x)) \exp(-K(p)) \dee p \\
  &=  \exp(-U(x)) \int \exp(-K(p)) \dee p \\ 
  &\propto \pi(x),
  \end{align*}
  using that $\exp(-K(p))$ is proportional to a standard normal density.
- Hence if we can get samples from $\bar \pi$ we automatically get samples from $\pi$! 
    - Just discard the momenta $p$.
- Finally:
    - if we propose $(x^{(t)}, p^{(t)})$ by "rolling a marble on $U$", starting at the current point  $(x^{(0)}, p^{(0)})$
    - we get $\text{Hamiltonian}^{(t)} = \text{Hamiltonian}^{(0)}$, 
    - i.e. $\bar \pi(x^{(t)}, p^{(t)}) = \bar \pi(x^{(0)}, p^{(0)})$,
    - i.e. the MH ratio is one, so we automatically accept!
- In practice, we need to approximate the motion of the "rolling marble" so we get $\bar \pi(x^{(t)}, p^{(t)}) \approx \bar \pi(x^{(0)}, p^{(0)})$ instead.


## Augmentation

- The general idea of adding an extra variable to help sampling (like $p$ here) is frequently used to design MCMC algorithms. 
- Terminology:
    - the variable we add (e.g. $p$ here), is called an **auxiliary variable,**
    - the joint distribution over the auxiliary variable and the one of interest $x$ is called the **augmented distribution** $\bar \pi(x, p)$.
- Generally, we want $\int \bar \pi(x, p) \dee p = \pi(x)$ so that we can easily recover the sample of interest.


## Sampling a new momentum

- Notice that $K$ is a quadratic function. 
- Hence, $\exp(\text{quadratic})$ is just a normal distribution!
- How to sample a new momentum?
    - Just sample $p$ from a standard normal...
    - ... while keeping $x$ the same.
    - This is an example of **Gibbs sampling**.
- Denote the above kernel by $\Kg$. 
  
**Proposition:** $\Kg$ is $\bar \pi$-invariant. 

**Proof idea:** we show a similar result in the discrete case to simplify notation. 

- Suppose $\bar \pi(x) = \pi_1(x_1) \pi_2(x_2)$, $x = (x_1, x_2)$ as with HMC 
    - (to map to the above example, think of $x_1$ as $x$ and $x_2$ as $p$). 
- Define $K(x' | x) = \ind[x_1 = x'_1] \pi_2(x'_2)$. 
- Note we have detailed balance:
\begin{align*}
\bar \pi(x) K(x' | x) &= \pi_1(x_1) \pi_2(x_2) \ind[x_1 = x'_1] \pi_2(x'_2) \\
&= \pi_1(\red{x'_1}) \pi_2(x_2) \ind[x_1 = x'_1] \pi_2(x'_2) \expl{thanks to the indicator} \\
&= \pi_1(x'_1) \pi_2(x_2) \ind[\red{x'_1 = x_1}] \pi_2(x'_2) \\
&= \pi_1(x'_1) \red{\pi_2(x'_2)} \ind[x'_1 = x_1] \red{\pi_2(x_2)} \\
&= \bar \pi(x') K(x | x'),
\end{align*}
- hence global balance holds. 


## High-level picture

HMC [alternates](topic07_alternation.qmd) between two kernels:

- a complicated kernel $\Kh$: "rolling the ball", combined with MH accept-reject which we will explore in more details
- a simple kernel $\Kg$: Gibbs sampling on the momentum.
