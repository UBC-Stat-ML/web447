## This week's outline

By "MCMC hacking," I mean learning the tools to:

1. Predict when some MCMC algorithm will fail.
2. Strategies to fix it. 
3. How to write a new MCMC algorithm. 
4. How to debut your MCMC code.

## Rationale

We need to write new MCMC algorithm because there are 
situations that Stan/other PPLs cannot handle automatically. 

**Some examples:**

- [Phylogenetic tree inference](https://www.routledge.com/Bayesian-Phylogenetics-Methods-Algorithms-and-Applications/Chen-Kuo-Lewis/p/book/9781466500792)
- [Analysis of network data](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/rssb.12289)
- [Proto-language reconstruction](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1204678110)
- [Multiple sequence alignment](https://www.bali-phy.org/)
