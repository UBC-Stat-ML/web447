## Outline

### Topics

- Homogeneous Markov chains
- Transition kernel
- Initial distribution 
- MH as a Markov chain


### Rationale

**Why** is the [MH ratio](../w08_mcmc1/topic04_mh.qmd) defined as $\gamma(x')/\gamma(x)$?

If we modified the MH ratio, would MCMC still "work"?

**Recall:** by "MCMC still work" we mean "MCMC still be [consistent](../w08_mcmc1/topic05_mcmc_consistency.qmd)" i.e. enjoy a law of large numbers. 


## Markov chain definitions

**To answer the question above:**

- we need to study in more details law of large numbers for **Markov chains**. 
- We will need some concepts related to Markov chains

**Recall:** the random variables $X^{(1)}, X^{(2)}, \dots$ are called a Markov chain 
    if they admit the following "chain" graphical model.

**Note:** today we will assume the state space is discrete, we'll relax this soon. 

**Definition:** let $K_m(x' | x) = \pr(X^{(m+1)} = x' | X^\parm = x)$. We call $K_m$ the **transition kernel** (for the $m$-th step).

**Definition:** if all the transition kernels are equal, $K_m = K$ for some $K$, we say the Markov chain is **homogeneous**. 

**Definition:** the marginal distribution of the first state, $X^{(1)}$ is called the **initial distribution**. 


## The MH algorithm as a Markov chain  

Recall MH involves:

- a proposal $q(x'|x)$
- a MH ratio $r(x, x') = \gamma(x') / \gamma(x)$, and
- an **acceptance probability** $\alpha(x, x') = \min(1, r(x, x'))$. 

**Question:** write the transition kernel $K(x' | x)$, assuming $x \neq x'$.
