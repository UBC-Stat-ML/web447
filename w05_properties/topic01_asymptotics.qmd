## Outline

### Topics

- The notion of asymptotic analysis.
- The two asymptotic regimes considered in this class. 

### Rationale

In statistics, asymptotic analysis is an important tool to understand any estimator, 
including Bayesian estimators and Monte Carlo methods. 


## A first type of asymptotics: consistency of Monte Carlo methods

**Example:** suppose you are trying to estimate the slope parameter in 
  [last week's regression model](../w04_glms/topic05_regression.qmd).

- Typical situation:
    - Fix one Bayesian model and one dataset.
    - You are interested in $g^* = \ex[g(X) | Y = y]$
        - e.g., $g(\text{slope}, \text{sd}) = \text{slope}$ in last week's regression example.
    - You try simPPLe with $M = 100$ iterations, get a Monte Carlo approximation $\hat G_{M} \approx \ex[g(X) | Y = y]$
    - Then you try $M = 1000$ iterations to gauge the quality of the Monte Carlo approximation $\hat G_{M}$.
    - Then you try $M = 10 000$, etc.
- Mathematical guarantee: [we proved (Monte Carlo) consistency,](../w03_ppl/topic04_consistency.qmd)
    - i.e. that $\hat G_{M}$ can get arbitrarily close to $g^*$. 

**Monte Carlo consistency:** the limit $M\to\infty$ gives us a first example of asymptotic regime: "infinite computation."
    

## A second type of asymptotics: "big data"

**Question:** even after $M \to \infty$, can there still be an error in the "infinite compute" limit $g^*$?

You will explore this question in [this week's exercises](../exercises/ex05.qmd).

To help you preparing for this exercise, we will first go back to the first type 
of asymptotics (Monte Carlo consistency) [in more depth](../w03_ppl/topic05_mc_rates.qmd).
