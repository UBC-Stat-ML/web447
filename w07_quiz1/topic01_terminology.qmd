## Outline

### Topics

- Review of key terminology covered so far.  

### Rationale

Part of quiz 1 involves knowing these terms 
without having to look them up. 

While in "the real world" you can look things up, to attain mastery 
of a subject you need a critical mass of concepts in memory. 
Too much google look-ups  prevent thinking  
at the speed of thought.


## Probability essentials

- Probability vs PMF vs density
- Event vs outcome
- Random variable
- Realization
- Probability and conditional probability
- Expectation vs probability
- Indicator function


## Common distributions (PMFs and densities)

Knowing the **support** (no need to memorize other details)

- Bernoulli
- Binomial
- Uniform (discrete and continuous)
- Categorical
- Normal
- Exponential
- Beta


## Basic Bayesian terms

- Prior distribution (PMF/density)
- Likelihood
- Posterior distribution (PMF/density)
- Joint distribution
- Joint vs marginal posterior
- Predictive distribution


## Sampling

- Sample
- Forward vs posterior sampling
- Simple Monte Carlo vs SNIS
- Test function


## Decision theory

- Loss function
- Bayes estimator


## Posterior summaries 

- Point estimate vs credible regions


## Point estimation

- Posterior mean
- Posterior mode


## Credible regions

- Nominal coverage
- Quantile-based credible interval
- Highest Density Set


## Model criticism

- Model mis-specification
- Cromwell's rule


## PPLs

- PPL
- Consistency
- Rate of convergence
- (Importance) weights (normalized vs un-normalized)


## Model terminology

- Classification vs regression
- Input/output/covariate
