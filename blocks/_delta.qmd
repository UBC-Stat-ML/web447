- You are consulting for a satellite operator
- They are about to send a $100M satellite on a Delta 7925H rocket
- **Data**: as of Jan 2024, Delta 7925H rockets have been launched 3 times, with
0 failed launches <!-- Source: https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_lau_det/delta-7925h.htm -->
  - Note: Delta 7925H is not reusable, so each rocket is "copy" built from the
  same blueprint
- Should you recommend buying a $2M insurance policy?
