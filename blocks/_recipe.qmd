1. Construct a **probability model** including
    - random variables for what we will measure/observe
    - random variables for the unknown quantities
        - those we are interested in ("parameters", "predictions")
        - others that just help us formulate the problem ("nuisance", "random effects").
2. Compute the **posterior distribution** (condition on the data)
3. Use the posterior distribution to (**decision theory**):
    - make prediction (point estimate)
    - estimate uncertainty (credible intervals)
    - make a decision
