-   Imagine a bag with 3 coins each with a different probability parameter $p$
-   Coin $i\in \{0, 1, 2\}$ has bias $i/2$---in other words:
    -   First coin: bias is $0/2 = 0$ (i.e. both sides are "tails", $p = 0$)
    -   Second coin: bias is $1/2 = 0.5$ (i.e. standard coin, $p = 1/2$)
    -   Third coin: bias is $2/2 = 1$ (i.e. both sides are "heads", $p = 1$)

-   Consider the following two steps sampling process
    -   Step 1: pick one of the three coins, but do not look at it!
    -   Step 2: flip the coin 4 times
-   Mathematically, this probability model can be written as follows: $$
    \begin{align*}
    X &\sim \distUnif\{0, 1, 2\} \\
    Y_i | X &\sim \distBern(X/2)
    \end{align*}
