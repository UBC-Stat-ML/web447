- Imagine a bag with 3 biased coins
- Coin $i\in \{0, 1, 2\}$ has bias $i/2$---in other words:
  - First coin: bias is $0/2 = 0$ (i.e. both sides are "tails")
  - Second coin: bias is $1/2 = 0.5$ (i.e. standard coin)
  - Third coin: bias is $2/2 = 1$ (i.e. both sides are "heads")

- Consider the following two steps sampling process
  - Step 1: pick one of the three coins, but do not look at it!
  - Step 2: flip the coin 4 times and observe the flips
- Our "bag of coin" example explores the following probabilistic inference problem:

> If you observe 4 heads, what is the probability that you picked the standard coin?
