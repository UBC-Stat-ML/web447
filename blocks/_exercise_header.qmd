## Grading

Our priority with the weekly exercises is to provide timely feedback and 
an incentive to stay on top of the material so that lectures can 
be more effective.

We will select one or more questions that will be graded in more detail. 
For the other question(s), we will use the following particiation-centric binary scheme: 

- 1 point if something reasonable was attempted, 
- 0 otherwise.
