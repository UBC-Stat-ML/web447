## Not for grades!

These are not essential for learning the material and can be skipped without affecting your grade. 
If you successfully solve one set of problem, a week of participation activity will be waived 
(it does not have to be the same week you submit the challenge question). 
Submit your answer at any time. 
I will not post solutions for the challenge questions.
