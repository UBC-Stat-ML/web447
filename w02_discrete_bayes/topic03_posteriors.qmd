## Outline 

### Topics

- Notion of posterior distribution. 
- Examples
- How to use a posterior?


### Rationale

The posterior distribution appears in the second step of the Bayesian 
Recipe and is therefore encountered (at least implicitly) in all full Bayesian problems. 


## Definition

The conditional PMF of the unknowns $X$ given the observation $Y$ is the called the **posterior PMF**.[^1]

[^1]: if the unknown quantity is continuous, the posterior will be expressed using a density. 
  A term that captures both the continuous and discrete case is "distribution" 
  i.e. "posterior distribution". 
  
  
### Notation

We use $\pi(x) = \pr(X = x | Y = y)$ for the posterior PMF. 

**Recall:**

$$\pi(x) = \frac{\gamma(x)}{Z},$$

where $\gamma(x) = \pr(X = x, Y = y)$ is the un-normalized posterior and $Z = \pr(Y = y)$ is the 
normalization constant. 


## Examples

### Example 1: coins in a bag

Visualization of the prior PMF and how it arises from the decision tree and random variable $X$ (showing 3 flips instead of 4):

- Recall that the probability of each path is the product of the edge labels. 

Visualization of the **posterior** PMF and how it arises from the decision tree and random variable $X$:

- Recall we zero out the contribution of the paths not compatible with the observation (Heads, Heads, Heads). 
- This gives a list of numbers that do not sum to one, so we renormalize them.


### Example 2: rocket insurance

You will construct prior and posterior PMFs in [question 2 of this week's exercises](../exercises/ex02.qmd#sec-q2).


## What to do with a posterior?

- Show a visualiation (posterior PMF). 
- Compute a **summary** of the PMF:
    - **point estimate:** single "best guess", or 
    - **a credible region:** a set of "guesses". 
- More generally: decision theory / Step 3 of the [Bayesian Recipe](topic01_bayes_recipe.qmd).
