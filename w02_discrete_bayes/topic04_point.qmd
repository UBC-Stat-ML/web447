## Outline 

### Topics

- Common point estimates:
    - Posterior mean. 
    - Posterior mode. 


### Rationale

It is often necessary to summarize the posterior distribution with a single "best guess", 
even though as we will see this hides important information namely our uncertainty 
about that guess. 


## Definitions

- Let $\pi(x) = \pr(X = x | Y = y)$ denote a posterior PMF. 
- **Point estimate:** Instead of plotting the full information in $\pi$, 
  we can report a "location" summary such as the mean of the posterior $\pi$. 


### Posterior mean

Recall the mean is computed from a PMF via 
$$\sum_x x\; \pi(x),$$
where the sum is over $\{x : \pi(x) > 0 \}$. 

**Notation:** the posterior mean is denoted $\ex[X | Y = y] = \sum x\ \pi(x)$. 

### Posterior mode

The **mode** is the location of the "tallest stick" in the PMF. 

**Notation:** $\argmax \pi(x),$ i.e. the point that achieves the maximum of $\pi$.

In the Bayesian context, the mode of a posterior PMF is also known as 
the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimator. 

## Examples

### Example 1

In the following, we will compute point estimates based on 
$\pi(x) = \pr(X = x | Y = (1, 1))$ in the bag of coin running example (notice we observe only **two coin flips** here). 

-   Imagine a bag with 3 coins each with a different probability parameter $p$
-   Coin $i\in \{0, 1, 2\}$ has bias $i/2$---in other words:
    -   First coin: bias is $0/2 = 0$ (i.e. both sides are "heads", $p = 0$)
    -   Second coin: bias is $1/2 = 0.5$ (i.e. standard coin, $p = 1/2$)
    -   Third coin: bias is $2/2 = 1$ (i.e. both sides are "tails", $p = 1$)

-   Consider the following two steps sampling process
    -   Step 1: pick one of the three coins, but do not look at it!
    -   Step 2: flip the coin **2** times
-   Mathematically, this probability model can be written as follows: $$
    \begin{align*}
    X &\sim \distUnif\{0, 1, 2\} \\
    Y_i | X &\sim \distBern(X/2)
    \end{align*}
