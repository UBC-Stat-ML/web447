### Rationale



## Decision theory without uncertainty 

Your friend proposes the following game (a good model for any lottery!):

- She flips a standard coin:
    - if it's a "heads": you give her \$10 
    - if it's a "tails": she gives you \$9. 
- Your decision: to play or not to play?

## Decision theory with uncertainty

<!--

## Example: disease screening

- "Screening policy": recommend to doctors to do a certain disease test 
    every year for everyone in a group 
      - e.g. mammograms for women over 40 to screen breast cancer.
- Decision: a jurisdiction is deciding whether to enact a screening policy or not in a given group.
- Factors:
    - Early disease detection can prevent deaths.
    - But false positives can lead to un-necessary impact to healthy people. 
    
Terminology:

- "positive" / "positive": the test says "yes" / "no"
- "false positive": the test says yes when the individual was healthy
- "false negative": the test says no when the individual was sick.
