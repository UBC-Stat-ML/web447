## Outline

### Topics

- Nominal coverage. 
- Common credible sets:
    - Quantiles. 
    - Highest-density sets.


### Rationale

As [we have seen at the beginning](../w00_intro/topic01_why.qmd) one motivation for Bayesian methods is that 
they allow us to quantify uncertainty in our predictions. Credible sets is 
one way to convey this uncertainty quantification. 


## Nominal coverage

The "nominal coverage" is the basic property that we use to construct credible sets:

- You are given a level, typically $95\%$ or $90\%$, denoted $1-\alpha = 0.95$ or $1-\alpha = 0.9$
    - Intuition: we want to find a set $T$ such that we are $95\%$ sure that the true $x$ is in $T$. 
- Ideally, we would want to find a set $T$ such that $\sum_{x \in T} p(x) = 0.9$
    - For discrete distributions, there may not be a solution, but let us ignore that issue for now (suppose each probability is very small and replace $=$ by $\approx$ up to an error bounded by the largest individual probability)
    - For continuous distributions that will not be an issue
- Another problem: there are many solutions! Some of them might appear weird, e.g. include points of probability zero!
    - Example: both sets shown in red contain $75\%$ of the mass.

## Quantile-based credible interval

The simplest way of building credible intervals:

- suppose you want a $90\%$ credible set
- we will remove $10\%/2 = 5\%$ on each side
- remove sticks from the very left moving to right
    - each time you remove one, add its length to a counter...
    - until that counter hits $5\%$. 
- then do the same from very right moving to the left
- the sticks left form $T$. 


## Highest Density Set

- **Highest Density Set**: pick a solution with the least number of points $|T|$
- To handle discrete models: $\text{argmin}\{ |T| : \sum_{x \in T} p(x) \ge 0.9\}$.
    - Still not unique in some corner cases, but good enough 

**Example:** 

- the left one below is a highest density set 
- note the one on the right has more points in it, $5 < 9$.

**Challenge:** implement a function taking as input a posterior PMF (as a vector), a level, and returns an HDI. [Details here.](../challenges/ch02.qmd)


## Credible interval

When we move to continuous random variables, $T$ will often be an interval, i.e. $T = [L, R]$ for some left and right end points $L$ and $R$. 
In such case, $T$ is called a credible interval. 


## High Density Interval

Similarly, a High Density Interval (HDI) is a shortest interval (i.e. minimizing $R - L$) containing a prescribed probability mass.
