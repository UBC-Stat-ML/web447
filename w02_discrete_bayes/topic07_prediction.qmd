## Outline

### Topics

- Prediction using decision trees
- Example

### Rationale

Often we do not care so much about "parameters" but instead about predicting future observations. 


## Example: coins in a bag

Consider the setup from last week with 3 coins and 3 flips with $Y = (1, 1, 1)$ 
(in the following, let $\ones$ denote a vector of 1's). 

**Question:** given you have see 3 heads, what is the probability that the next one is also heads?

**Mathematically:** $\pr(Y_4 = 1 | Y_{1:3} = \ones)$. This is known as "prediction".


## General approach

**Key message:** In Bayesian statistics, prediction and parameter estimation are treated in the exact same way!

**Idea:** Add $Y_4$ to the unobserved random variables, i.e. set $\tilde X = (X, Y_4)$. 

Then, to compute $\pr(Y_4 = 1 | Y_{1:3} = \ones)$ use same techniques as 
last week (decision tree, chain rule, axioms of probability).


## Example, continued

Use the following picture to help you computing $\pr(Y_4 = 1 | Y_{1:3} = \ones)$.
