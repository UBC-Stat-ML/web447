## Outline

### Topics

- What is a model mis-specification?
- What are the consequences?
- What to do about it.


### Rationale

Model mis-specification (the model being "too wrong") can lead to serious problems 
in all types of statistical models, 
but Bayesian models are often more seriously affected. 
As a result it is important to detect serious cases of mis-specification and to 
address them. This is just an introduction, we will go in more depth once 
we have introduced Bayesian regression models. 


## Definitions

**Model mis-specification:** when the model is "too wrong" (in the context of [the famous quote by George Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong)).

**Model criticism:** the task of trying to find mis-specification. 

- It can be done by reasoning and discussion with experts. 
- It can be done using data (**goodness-of-fit**)


### Example 

**Recall our notation:** $\rho$ prior PMF, $\pi$ posterior PMF. 

- Suppose we put zero prior mass to having a fair dice. What happens on the posterior?

- If we put prior mass of zero to some realization $x$, say $\rho(x) = 0$ then the posterior probability on $x$ will always be zero, $\pi(x) = 0$, *no matter how many observations we get*
    - This could be disastrous! (e.g. ignoring extreme scenarios can have extreme consequences)
- Principle to avoid this is known as **Cromwell's rule** (Oliver Cromwell, 1650): "I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible that you may be mistaken."

**Discussion:** can you identify other issues with the model from Exercise 2?


## How to correct mis-specification

- Improve the model!
- Then iterate with more criticism and improve again if needed.
- Iterative model improvement is part of the current "best practice" in Bayesian analysis.
