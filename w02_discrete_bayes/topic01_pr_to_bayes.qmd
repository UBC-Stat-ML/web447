## Outline

### Topics

- Bayesian interpretation of probability models: from aleatoric to epistemic. 
- Terminology: prior, likelihood, joint.

### Rationale

This week, we will give a new interpretation to the "bag of coin" example 
(where the uncertainty is "aleatoric"), turning it into a Bayesian model 
(where the uncertainty is "epistemic").
Mathematically this is the same model but with a different interpretation. 
This shift of interpretation is the basis of all Bayesian models. 


## This week's running example

- We designed a rocket.
- We build a bunch of **copies** of the rocket, launch them and enjoy the show!

**Motivating question:**

- We observe 4 successful launches. 
- What is the probability that the next launch is a success?
