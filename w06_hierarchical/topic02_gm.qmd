## Outline

### Topics

- Directed graphical models. 

### Rationale

Graphical models help understanding complex models such as hierarchical ones 


## Directed graphical model

A graphical model is a discrete graph showing the dependencies involved in a 
  [forward sampling description of a model](../w01_discrete_inference/topic06_forward_sampling.qmd#sec-model).
  Specifically:

**Definition:** a directed graphical model is a discrete graph such that:

- the set of vertices is a set of random variables,
- there is an edge $X_1 \to X_2$ if the forward sampling step producing $X_2$ requires knowing $X_1$. 


## Examples

### Exchangeable observations

Many simples models can be written as:

::: column-margin
![](../images/naive-bayes.png){width="200"}
:::

$$\begin{align*}
\theta &\sim \text{SomePrior} \\
y_i | \theta &\sim \text{SomeLikelihood}(\theta).
\end{align*}$$

Most of the models we have encountered so far have this form. 


### Hidden Markov model

Time series are often modelled as follows:

::: column-margin
![](../images/hmm.png){width="200"}
:::

- there is an unobserved state $x_t$ changing at each time step $t \in \{1, 2, \dots\}$
    - e.g. true location of a plane,
- we have noisy observations $y_t$ from this true position,
    - e.g. information from a radar. 
    
Simplest HMM example:

$$\begin{align*}
x_i | x_{i-1} &\sim \distNorm(x_{i-1}, \sigma_1) \\
y_i | x_i &\sim \distNorm(x_{i}, \sigma_2),
\end{align*}$$

where $\sigma_1$ controls the amount of variability in the dynamics, and $\sigma_2$, in the measurement. 


## Conditioning

Shaded nodes in a directed graphical models indicate what we condition on (i.e. what we observe).

## Plates

::: column-margin
![](../images/plate.png){height="200"}
:::

**Plate:** When there are too many vertices to draw in a graphical model, use a square ("plate") to indicate a group of nodes that are repeated several times. 
In other words, a graphical "for loop."


## Further pointers on graphical models

Directed graphical models are also useful to identify conditional independence relationships (recall, $A$ is conditionally independent of $B$ given $C$ if $\Pr(A|C) \Pr(B|C) = \Pr(A \cap B | C)$).
