## Outline

### Topics

-   Variational approximations
-   Distribution families
-   Posterior approximation as optimization

### Rationale

In certain situations, and for a finite time budget, variational methods 
can provide a better approximation than MCMC methods. 


## What is a variational method?

**Setup:** as in MCMC...

- we try to approximate a posterior $\pi(x)$ with $x \in \states$, 
- known only up to normalization constant, $\pi(x) = \gamma(x) / Z$. 

**Additional ingredient:** a family (set) of distributions, $\family = \{q_\phi : \phi \in \Phi\}$ called the **variational family.**[^1]

[^1]: Notice we also used $q$ for MCMC proposal and importance sampling's importance distribution. These are different but related. It is a general 
  convention to use $q$ for "quantities that help us to approximate a complex distribution." The connection between variational inference's $q$ and importance
  sampling's $q$ is more direct compared to MCMC's proposal $q$.

- Each element of the variational family is a density/PMF $q_\phi(x)$ defined on the same space as $\pi(x)$. 
- Each element is indexed by a **variational parameter** $\phi \in \Phi$. 

**Variational inference:** find a variational approximation $q^*_\phi\in\family$ as close as possible to the posterior $\pi$. 


## Distribution families

**Example:** consider the [beta-binomial example](../exercises/ex07.qmd#sec-q3).

- Here we could take $\family$ to be the set of all beta distributions. 
- The beta family has two positive parameters, $\phi = (\alpha, \beta)$, $\alpha, \beta > 0$...
- ... so $\Phi = \reals^+ \times \reals^+$. 
- This is the "best case" for variational inference:
  - from [a practice quiz exercise](../w07_quiz1/topic02_practice_questions.qmd#beta-binomial-conjugacy), $\pi \in \family$,
  - so $q^*_\phi = \pi$, i.e., variational inference incurs no approximation error in this special case (see figure). 
- Typically, we do not have tractable (easy to compute) conjugate family though. 

**Example:** when $\states = \reals$, a typical choice of variational family is to use a normal family.

**Question:** for the normal variational family, complete the definition of variational approximation $q_\phi$, variational parameter $\phi$ and parameters $\Phi$.
