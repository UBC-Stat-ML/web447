## Course description

Bayesian inference is a flexible and powerful approach to modeling reality, making optimal predictions from data, and quantifying uncertainty in a coherent manner. Thanks to their versatility, Bayesian methods are now widely used in virtually all fields of science, engineering, and beyond.

In **STAT 447C**, you will:

-   design probabilistic models to approach real-world inferential problems;
-   perform inference using Bayesian modelling languages;
-   critically assess, debug, and iteratively improve Bayesian workflows;
-   develop and analyze custom posterior approximation machinery.

## Lecture time and place

**Lecture dates:** January 9, 2024 to April 11, 2024. [Detailed schedule](schedule.qmd)

Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30-11:00. [FNH Building, Room 40.](https://learningspaces.ubc.ca/classrooms/fnh-40)

## Teaching team

-   [Alexandre Bouchard-Côté (Instructor)](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~bouchard/index.html)
-   [Miguel Biron-Lattes (TA)](https://miguelbiron.github.io/)
-   [Ali Mehrabian (TA)](mailto:alimehrabian619@yahoo.com)

## Prerequisite

-   Probability: STAT 302, MATH 302 or equivalent. I will do a review of the relevant concepts, but Bayesian statistics is entirely built on top of probability theory so prior exposure to probability is the key prerequisite for this course.
-   Basic background in linear algebra (e.g. matrix multiplication, eigenvectors) and calculus (see STAT 302's prerequisites for example)
-   Computing: we will use R in the homework and during lectures. If you know another programming language but not R, you can still take this course but be prepared to spend a bit of extra time to get familiar with the R syntax. We will have special office hours sessions at the beginning of the term to help you doing that.

Come talk to me at the end of the first lecture if you are unsure about your preparation for this course.

## Software

All software used is free and open source. Some key tools we will use:

-   [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
-   [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
-   [RStan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan)

We assume you have a laptop on which you can install these tools, if not, you may be able to [borrow one from UBC library](https://services.library.ubc.ca/computers-technology/technology-borrowing/).

## Textbook

Notes will be provided and complemented with readings from the following freely available textbook:

## Assessments

Click on each item for details.

-   Participation: 15%
    -   Weekly reading assignment: each week ask and answer one question about [the readings or lectures](schedule.qmd) on {{< var piazza >}}.
    -   In-class iClicker questions: only participations points (unless your score is indistinguishable from random). Setup iClicker Cloud on {{< var canvas >}}.
-   Homework: 15%
    -   Weekly.
    -   Released and submitted on {{< var canvas >}}.
-   Quizzes (2 x 20%): 40%
    -   In-class.
    -   Dates: Tuesday February 27, Tuesday March 26.
-   [Final project](project.qmd): 30%

For the reading assignment and homework, we will drop the lowest week. For the iClicker, we will automatically skip up to two missed lectures. Keep these for sick days/unforeseen circumstances. No need to ask for permission/provide doctor's note, this will be done automatically for everyone.

Added on Jan 10: *For exercise grading, I will take the $\max(\text{mean}(e_1, e_2, ...), \text{mean}(e_2, e_3, ...))$, where $e_1, e_2, e_3, \dots$ are the scores for the different exercises.
The same applies for clicker participation points.
(This was put in place to help a couple 
students travelling in the first week, but will be automatically applied for everyone so no need to request it).*

Added on Jan 15: *Once in a while, I will post some "challenge questions". 
These are not essential for learning the material and can be skipped. 
Submit your answer at any time. 
For each that you successfully solve, a week of participation activity will be waived 
(it does not have to be the same week you submit the challenge question). 
I will not post solutions for the challenge questions.*

Added on Jan 21: *Since a few more people arrived in the second week, I will extend the Jan 10 waiver above to cover the 
first two week, i.e. using $\max(\text{mean}(e_1, e_2, ...), \text{mean}(e_2, e_3, ...), \text{mean}(e_3, ...))$, so 
you can still get full marks if you do not do exercises and/or participation/clicker in weeks 1 or 2.*



## Office hours

-   Instructor office hour: Thursdays, 3:30-4:30, ESB 3125
-   TA office hour: Fridays, 11:00-12:00, ESB 3125

Available by appointment if you are unable to attend drop-in hours.

## Course communication

### Announcements

Course announcements will be posted on {{< var canvas >}}.

### Questions

Use {{< var piazza >}} for questions about the material, logistics, etc. Use public posts as much as possible so that other students can learn from the discussion.

Use private piazza questions if, and only if the question is about a personal matter.
