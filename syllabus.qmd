## Course description

Bayesian inference is a flexible and powerful approach to modeling reality, making optimal predictions from data, and quantifying uncertainty in a coherent manner. Thanks to their versatility, Bayesian methods are now widely used in virtually all fields of science, engineering, and beyond.

In this course, you will:

-   design probabilistic models to approach real-world inferential problems;
-   perform inference using Bayesian modelling languages;
-   critically assess, debug, and iteratively improve Bayesian workflows;
-   develop and analyze custom posterior approximation machinery.


## Lecture time and place

Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30-11:00. [FNH Building, Room 40.](https://learningspaces.ubc.ca/classrooms/fnh-40)

## Teaching team

-   [Alexandre Bouchard-Côté (Instructor)](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~bouchard/index.html)
-   [Miguel Biron-Lattes (TA)](https://miguelbiron.github.io/)
-   **TBA** (TA)

## Prerequisite

-   Probability: STAT 302, MATH 302 or equivalent.
-   Basic background in linear algebra (e.g. matrix multiplication, eigenvectors) and calculus (see STAT 302 pre-requisites for example)
-   Computing: we will use R in the homeworks and during lectures. If you know another programming language but not R, you can still take this course but be prepared to spend a bit of extra time to get familiar with the R syntax. We will have special office hours sessions at the beginning of the term to help you doing that.

Come talk to me at the end of the first lecture if you are unsure about your preparation for this course.

## Course communication

### Announcements

Course announcements will be posted in the [Canvas page]({{< var canvas >}}).


### Questions

Use the [Piazza page]({{< var piazza >}}) for questions about the material, logistics, etc. Use public posts as much as possible so that other students can learn from the discussion.

Use private piazza questions if, and only if the question is about a personal matter.
