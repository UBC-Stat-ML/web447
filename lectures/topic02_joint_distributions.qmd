## Outline

- Synthetic data
- Forward simulation


## Conventions

- $X$: unobserved random variable 
- $Y$: observed random variable


## Key concept: synthetic dataset

- Soon: predict unknown $X$ from $Y$
- Now: "playing god" i.e. sampling both $X$ and $Y$


- convention: x for observed random variable, y for observed
- concept: synthetic data
- concept: forward simulation
- introduce running example, exercise question give some hints
