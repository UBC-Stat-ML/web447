## Outline

### Topics

-   Review of key concepts for continuous random variables. 
    - Density. 
    - Computing their expectation. 
-   Bayes rule with continuous random variables. 

### Rationale

Since the parameters of distributions families are continuous, it 
natural to use continuous random variables for them in Bayesian statistics. 
For example it lets us get rid of the artificial discretization $K$ 
we used in [last week's exercise](../exercises/ex02.qmd). 

Today we will approach the calculations with both manual mathematic 
derivation and PPLs. Later we will increasingly rely only on PPLs. 
But it is still important to understand both methods. 


## Densities

**Definition:** $X$ has density $f(x)$ if 
  $$\pr(X \in A) = \int_A f(x) \dee x.$$ 
  
**LOTUS:** works the same as [with discrete models](../w01_discrete_inference/topic10_expectations.qmd):
  $$\ex[g(X)] = \int f(x) g(x) \dee x.$$ 
  
  
## Joint densities 

**Definition:** $(X, Y)$ has joint density $f(x, y)$ if 
  $$\pr((X, Y) \in A) = \int \int_A f(x, y) \dee x.$$ 

## Key properties

Note that in much of what follows, everything works the same as with 
[with discrete models](../w01_discrete_inference/topic10_expectations.qmd) 
except we replace sums by integrals and PMFs $p$ by densities $f$.

**LOTUS:** 
  $$\ex[g(X, Y)] = \int f(x, y) g(x, y) \dee x.$$ 

**Marginalization:** going from a joint density on $(X, Y)$ to the density of $X$ only (the latter is called the marginal):
  $$f_X(x) = \int f(x, y) \dee y.$$
  
**Chain rule:** 
  $$f(x, y) = f_X(x) f_{Y|X}(y|x).$$

**Bayes theorem:**
  $$f_{X|Y}(x|y) = \frac{f(x, y)}{f_Y(y)}.$$
  
  
## Example: Doomsday model

### Mathematical description

Consider the following joint density described using chain rule:
$$\begin{align*}
X &\sim \distUnif(0, 5) \\
Y | X &\sim \distUnif(0, X).
\end{align*}$$


### Aleatoric interpretation

- I have a measuring tape, but you do not know how long is it.
  - Length of tape: $X$.
  - Let's say we think itâ€™s less than 5m.
- I go in a separate room, unroll it fully, and pick a number at random from the tape.
  - Random point on tape: $Y$
  
**Goal:** from the $Y$, trying to guess the full length of the tape.  


### Epistemic interpretation

- $X$ is the total number of humans to ever live, future and past (in trillion). 
- $Y$ is the number of humans that were born before present (from archeological records, ~0.06 trillion).

**Goal:** Can we guess (probabilistically) how many more human there will ever be in total? 

This is known as the [Doomsday argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_argument)


### Computations on the Doomsday model

**Joint density:** which of these is the joint density?

**Marginal density:** compute the marginal $f_Y(y)$

**Posterior density:** from our marginal and Bayes' theorem, we obtain
  $$f_{X|Y}(x|y) = \frac{\ind[0<x<5] \ind[0 < y < x]}{x (\log 5 - \log y)}.$$

**Posterior expectation:** compute $\ex[X|Y = 0.06]$
