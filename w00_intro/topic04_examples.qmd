- Origins of life/cancer/language and characterization of their respective evolutionary processes
- Modelling high-throughput genomics data (single-cell sequencing, CRISPR-CAS9, ultra-deep, expression) 
- Black-hole imaging
- "Classical" tasks: classification, regression, clustering, etc
- A/B testing and Bayesian optimization
- Determining fate of the universe from cosmic microwave background
