**So... what *is* Bayesian Analysis?**

### Preview of key definitions

**Bayesian Analysis:** statistical discipline centered around the use of **Bayes estimators** 

**Bayes estimators:** for data $Y$, unobserved $X$, loss $L$, and possible actions $A$, the Bayes estimator is defined as:

$$\argmin \{ \E[L(a, X) | Y] : a \in A \}$$

**Note:** you are not expected to understand this equation at this point!

### This course

The primary objective of this course is to understand Bayes estimators:

- Why they are so powerful.
- Their limitations (model misspecification, computational challenges).
- Important special cases (posterior means, credible intervals, MAP).
- How to do it in practice
    - how to build models
    - how to approximate conditional expectations.
