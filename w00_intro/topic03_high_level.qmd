## "Bayesian Recipe": high-level picture

{{< include ../blocks/_recipe.qmd >}}

## Plan

- First week: probability essentials (foundations for steps 1 and 2 of the Bayesian Recipe)
- Second week: steps 1, 2, 3 for one specific discrete probability models
- Third week and beyond: step 1, 2, 3 for arbitrary models


## First step of the Recipe: "constructing a probability model"

- What is a model?
- What is a probability model?
- Example (week 2): building a probability model for the rocket launch problem.


## What is a model?

**(Scientific) model:** A simplification of reality amenable to mathematical investigation.

$$\text{Reality} \xrightarrow{\text{Art + Scientific method}} \text{Model} \xrightarrow{\text{Mathematics}} \text{Prediction}$$

- In this course "mathematics" will be Bayesian analysis/probability theory. 
- Bayesian analysis/probability theory assume a model as starting point. 
    - To create a first model is a bit of an art. It comes with data analysis experience.
    - Then after we start with an initial model we can improve it by checking predictions against reality.
