## Bayesian analysis: pros and cons

- Address most data analysis issues (missing data, non-standard data types, non-iid, weird loss functions, adding expert knowledge, ...)
    - Bayesian analysis: address those in a (semi) automated fashion / principled framework ("reductionist")
        - Reductionism can be bad or good (main con of reductionism is computational)
    - Frequentist statistics: every problem is a new problem
- Implementation complexity
    - Efficient in analyst's time (thanks to PPLs)
    - Harder to scale computationally
    - $\Longrightarrow$ shines on small data problems (there a much more of those than the "big data" hype would like you to think)
- Statistical properties
    - Optimal if the model is **well-specified**
    - Sub-optimal in certain cases when the model is **mis-specified**
        - Thankfully the modelling flexibility makes it easier to build better models
        - Important to make model checks
        
        
## Week 2 example

- *Would you rather get strapped to...* 
    - "shiny rocket": 1 success, 0 failures
    - "rugged rocket": 98 successes, 2 failures

## Paradox?
  
- Maximum likelihood *point estimates*: 
    - "shiny rocket": 100% success rate (1 success, 0 failures) 
    - "rugged rocket": 98% success rate (98 successes, 2 failures)
- What is missing?
    

## Uncertainty estimates

- Take-home message: 
    - Point estimates are often insufficient, and can be very dangerous
    - We want some **measure of uncertainty**
    
- Bayesian inference provides one way to build uncertainty measures
    - Bayesian measures of uncertainty we will describe: **credible intervals**

- Alternatives exist: 
    - **Confidence intervals**, from frequentist statistics
    - "End product" looks similar, but very different in interpretation and construction
    
    
## Uncertainty will not go away

- Just collect more data??
    - Just launch more rockets and wait?
    - In some cases the data is just "gone", i.e. we will never be able to collect more after a point (e.g.: phylogenetic tree inference)
